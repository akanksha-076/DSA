UNIT 1 – Time and Space Complexity Explanation

======================================================================
1 Recursive Factorial
=======================================================================

Recurrence Relation:
T(n) = T(n − 1) + 1
---------------------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity:
In recursive factorial, each function call makes exactly one recursive call until n becomes 1.
The total number of calls is equal to n.

Therefore,
Time Complexity = O(n)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Space Complexity:
Each recursive call is stored in the call stack.
The maximum depth of recursion is n.

Therefore,
Space Complexity = O(n)

=========================================================================
2️ Fibonacci (Naive Recursive)
===========================================================================

Recurrence Relation:
T(n) = T(n − 1) + T(n − 2) + 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity:
In naive recursion, each function call generates two further recursive calls.

For example:
fib(5) calls fib(4) and fib(3)
fib(4) again calls fib(3) and fib(2)

This leads to repeated computation of the same values multiple times.
As a result, the total number of calls grows exponentially.

Therefore,
Time Complexity = O(2ⁿ)
------------------------------------------------------------
Why Naive Fibonacci is Inefficient:

The same subproblems are solved multiple times.
The number of recursive calls increases very rapidly.
Execution time grows exponentially for large values of n.
Hence, it is inefficient for large inputs.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Space Complexity:
The maximum depth of recursion is n.

Therefore,
Space Complexity = O(n)

===============================================================
3️ Fibonacci (Memoized)
===============================================================

Concept:
Memoization stores previously computed values so that each value is calculated only once.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity:
Since each Fibonacci value from 0 to n is computed only once,
Time Complexity = O(n)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Space Complexity:
Memoization storage requires O(n) space.
Recursion stack requires O(n) space.

Therefore,
Space Complexity = O(n)

=================================================================
4️ Tower of Hanoi
=================================================================

Recurrence Relation:
T(n) = 2T(n − 1) + 1
Solving this recurrence gives:
T(n) = 2ⁿ − 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity:
The number of moves required to solve the problem doubles with each additional disk.

Therefore,
Time Complexity = O(2ⁿ)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Space Complexity:
The recursion depth is equal to the number of disks, which is n.

Therefore,
Space Complexity = O(n)

===============================================================
5️ Recursive Binary Search
===============================================================

Recurrence Relation:
T(n) = T(n/2) + 1
At each step, the search space is reduced to half of its previous size.

Example:
n → n/2 → n/4 → n/8 → … → 1

The number of times we can divide n by 2 until it becomes 1 is log₂(n).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore
Time Complexity = O(log n)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Space Complexity:
The recursion stack depth is equal to log n.

Therefore,
Space Complexity = O(log n)

==============================================================================
